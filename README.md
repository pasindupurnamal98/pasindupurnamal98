### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Pasindu Purnamal from Sri Lanka, and I am currently studying for a software engineering degree at the Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology. I am really interested in learning new languages such as React-Native and Dart and participating in the development of mobile applications using Java, web applications using React,php, and other design technologies. I am looking forward to helping other developers with open source software development.
